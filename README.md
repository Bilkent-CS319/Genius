Genius is an intelligence personal assistant for computers. This Intelligence personal assistant will run at the background as a Windows Service. User will use his/her voice to command Genius and it will execute these commands whether they are related about getting an information from internet or related with personal computer -like starting an application. Further features will be listed below. To activate Genius, or in other words to wake it up to listen user’s commands, user should simply say the magic words (i.e. “Hey Jarvis!” or ”Hey Siri”) to the microphone.

Like all other intelligence personal assistants in the industry (Cortana, Siri etc) Genius’s priority also will be helping user but not being a companion to her/him. Yet, as a secondary goal, we can implement first phases of the natural language processing to give Genius to reply simple user questions (i.e. “How are you?”, “What is your name?”). However, this won’t be advanced and shouldn’t be confused with other Artificial Intelligence Chat Bots.

Although these features can be expanded in near feature, we need to implement basic features which an assistant require to work functionally. Genius can recognize natural voice without the requirement for keyboard. Genius will answer questions according to their form. If question is asked to learn something new but not to execute something, using certain API’s, user can get answer right away. Or user can use Genius to start applications like Word, Paint..
